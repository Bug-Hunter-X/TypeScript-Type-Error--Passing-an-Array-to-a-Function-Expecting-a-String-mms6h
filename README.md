# TypeScript Type Error: Passing an Array to a Function Expecting a String

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a string but receives an array instead. The example shows how to fix this error by ensuring that the input type matches the function's expected type.

## Bug

The `greeter` function is defined to accept a single string argument. However, an array of strings is passed to it, causing a type error.

## Solution

The solution shows how to correct the input to match the function's expected type. This can be done either by passing a single string or by modifying the function to accept an array of strings.
